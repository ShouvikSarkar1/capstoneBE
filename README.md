# capstoneBE

Welcome to my Capstone Project!

This is the Backend side of my Capstone Project called GigFinder.
GigFinder is a website I designed to act as a hub for artists, promoters, and venues to connect and collaborate with each other.

In this app you will be able to sign up and log in to page. Once you are logged in you have access to a Google calendar and map in your dashboard. There will be a tab for events where Gigs can be posted to for users to find the connections they are searching for.

To run this application, you must download all the files in this repository. 

Once everything is downloaded, open your terminal within the CapstoneBE worspace and 'cd' into the backend folder with the command below.

cd Backend

Once you are in the Backend folder you can run the application with this command:

npm start

That will run the backend part of this application which is a MongoDB database using express. For full functionality you must also run the front end folder simultaneoulsy which can be downloaded from this repository:

Enjoy!
